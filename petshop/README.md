## Petshop

Using the truffle framework to build a very basic app. Followed [this](http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/pet-shop) tutorial.

Essentially is a smart contract that reserves pets for adoption, in addition to a basic UI which facilitates interaction with the contract.

Tools used:
- [Ganache](http://truffleframework.com/ganache/) to test the UI
- [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com) - Framework this app was built on
